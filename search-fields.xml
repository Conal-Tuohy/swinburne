<!-- 
	This file contains field definitions for the search and browse functions of the site.
	
	The definition controls three aspects of the fields:
	1	the field types in the Solr schema (how Solr should interpret the content)
	2	the field content (how the fields are populated from the TEI XML)
	3	the field display (how they are queried and displayed)
	
	The @name attribute defines the name of the field in Solr and in the HTTP query URIs. Use lower case, single token with no spaces.
	
	The @label attribute provides the field's label in the UI. Fields with no @label will not appear in the UI at all.
	
	The @type attribute controls how the content of the field is indexed by Solr: a type of "facet" causes the text to be treated as a single token;
	as does a type of "sort". Otherwise Solr treats the field as free text, and performs various kinds of tokenisation, stemming, etc, on it.
	
	The @xpath attribute defines the content of the field. 
	An XPath which returns a sequence of more than one item will produce a multi-valued field.
	The TEI namespace is the default. 
	The XPath version supported is 3.1.

	This field defines an "id" field which must identify the text uniquely and persistently. It is used by Solr as a unique identifier.
	-->

	This field defines a "title" field containing a composite value aggregated from various components of the msIdentifier.

	<!-- 
	This field, called "sort", is used as a sort key of last resort when displaying search results.
	When two or more documents are equally relevant to a search (which is the case, for instance, with a blank search,
	which returns all documents), then the documents will be sorted according to the settlement, region, collection, and idno.
	The field is not intended to be used for searching; only for sorting.
