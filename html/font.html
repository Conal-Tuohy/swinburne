		<h2>Newton Sans Font</h2>
		<p>The Chymistry of Isaac Newton Project collaborated with the Unicode Consortium's Technical Committee to introduce a 
		large number of common sixteenth and seventeenth-century alchemical symbols into the Unicode Standard. Our 
		<a href="/font/Alchemy%20Unicode%20Proposal---March%2031%202009.pdf">Alchemy Unicode Proposal</a> was officially 
		adopted in 2009-10 and incorporated in Unicode 6.0 and later. The Newton Sans font supports all of the symbols in the 
		<a href="/font/Unicode-U1F700.pdf">Unicode Alchemy plane</a>, which includes symbols that were in regular use in 
		printed publications in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
		<p>Newton, however, used many alchemical symbols that were not commonly used in the alchemical literature in the 
		seventeenth century. He also used another large set of typographical and editorial marks, including conventional symbols 
		of Latin and English abbreviature. The Newton Sans font also includes these symbols, all of which are documented on our 
		<a href="symbols">Symbols page</a>. They reside in the private use area, E000-EFFF, with some symbols residing in the 
		Miscellaneous Symbols area, 2600-26FF.</p>
		<p>You can download the open source Newton Sans font for use in research and writing. </p>

		<p>Save the ZIP file to your machine, uncompress it, then copy the .TTF file to the Fonts folder. The font will appear in your 
		font selection lists as <em>Newton Sans Regular</em> and can be used in word processing programs.</p>
